            Welcome to Silverstone UTC, Silverstone University Technical College (UTC) was one of the first UTCs to open nationwide, as part of a
            government-funded programme to give those aged 14-19 unparalleled pathways into university and rewarding industry careers. Students
            can now leave the traditional schooling environment to study GCSEs or A-Levels alongside industry-recognised qualifications focused 
            on meeting the requirements of employers and universities. <br><br><br><br>
